The **state space** of a problem is defined by the collection of a *initial state*, *actions*, and *transition model*.

The state space forms a directed network or graph in which the nodes are state and the links between the nodes ar actions. So it is in the form of a state diagram.

A **Path** in the state space is a sequence of states connected by a sequence of actions.

The following picture could be considered as a state space:
