Here we talk about how to construct a binary decision tree.
There are different ways to construct a ROBDD. One approach could be to just construct an OBDD, and then continue to reduce it.

But we are going to cover a more appealing approach. 

# Terminology
First we need to set some terminology:

- Nodes are represented as numbers: $0,1,2 \dotsc$ with 0 and 1 reserved as terminal nodes. 
- The variables in the ordering $x_1 < x_2 < \dots < x_n$
- ROBDD is stored in a table: $T : u \to (i,l,h)$ which maps a node $u$ to its three attributes $var(u) = i$, $low(u) = l$, and $high(u) = h$

# Algorithms to build ROBDDÂ´s
Here we will walk through some of chapter 4th ideas to construc a ROBDD[^1]

## Mk
Here it tries to create somekind of inverse table of $T$ called $H$.

The inverse table of $T(u) = (i, l, h)$, if and only if, $H(i,l,h) = u$ 

Here are the two operations needed on the two tables:

The following function $MK[T,H](i,l,h)$ searches the table $H$  for a node with variable index i and low-, high-branches $l,h$ and returns a matching node if one exists. Otherwise it creates a new node $u$, inserts it into $H$ and returns the identity of it. 

The running time of *MK* is $O(1)$ due to assumptions on the basic operations on $T$ and $H$.

## Build
Here is a picture showing how *Build* to compute the ROBDD:

The running time of *Build* is bad. The running time is $O(2^n)$. This is due to variable ordering with $n$ variables there will always be generated on the order of $2^n$ calls.
