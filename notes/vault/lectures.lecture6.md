## Symbolic representation
Symbolic representatino is when you accumulate a state to a more simpel data type.
```
state = {hungry, hasApple}

possible states = {0,0}, {0,1}, {1,0}, {1,1} 
```

Then a symbolic representation is:
```
state = !hasApple
```

Which represents the states:
```
{0,0}, {1,0}
```
