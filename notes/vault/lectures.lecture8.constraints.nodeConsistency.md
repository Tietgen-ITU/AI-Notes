Node consistency is when a variable $x_i$ satifies all it **unary constraints**[^1].

At one of the exams this was a question. But remember that if there are no unary constraints then nothing happens. Because node consistency is only for Unary constraints

[^1] Unary constraint is a constraint only involving a single variable e.g. $x_i \neq red$ or $x_i \gt 2$
