This chapter will look into what is called problem solving agents. It is a goal-based agent. 

*Problem solving agents* use atomic representations. That is states of the world are considered as wholes with no internal structure visible to the problem-solving algorithms.

The Goal-based agents that use more advanced factored or structured representations are usually called planning agents.
