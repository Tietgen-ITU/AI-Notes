We are not going to talk about boolean expressions which is the same as sentences.

#### Precedence
Is how who is the strongest. It determines what we do first. Unles something is wrapped in parenthesis. 

#### Substitution
It is somekind of assumption. Where it indicates e.g. that if there is an x then assign that value. Substitution looks like: 

$$
[0/x, 1/y]
$$
