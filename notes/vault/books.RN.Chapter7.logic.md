Logic must define somekind of semantic or meaning of sentences. These semantics defines the thruth of each sentence with respect to each possible world. 

Here is an example of semantic:

This here is also called model checking because it enumerates all possible model sto check that alpha is true in all models in which KB is true that is that

## Properties
- **Soundness / Truth preserving**:
    It is basically if it is true. The book describes the unsound inference procedure as an algorithm that comes up with things as it goes a long.
- **Completeness**:
    is if the inference algorithm is complete if it can derive any sentence that is entailed.
