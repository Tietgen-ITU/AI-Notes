There are four ways to measure performance when it comes to algorithms:
- **Completeness:** Is the algorithm guaranteed to find a solution when there is one?
- **Optimality:** Does the strategy find the optimal solution?
- **Time complexity:** How long does it take to find a solution?
- **Space complexity:** How much memory is needed to perform the search?
