Here there is some definitions to what AI is. However they are centered around different topics. 
The ones at the top is focused on the *though proccess and reasoning* where as the ones at the bottom is more focused at the *behaivor*. 

The ones at the left is measuring success in terms of *fidellity to human performance* where as the ones on the right measure it agaist an Ideal performance measure called *rationality*.

# Acting humanly - The Turing Test Approach
Is test where you give the AI a bunch of questions and see if another person can tell if it was a human who answered it or if it was a real life person. 

In order for a computer to pass such a test then it should handle these four capabilities:

Physical test was avoided in the turing test because it has nothing to do with *intelligence*.

## Total Turing Test
The total turing test involves video signals so that we can test the AI's perceptual abilities. In order for the AI to pass this test then it will need the following categories of AI:

These categories mentioned compose most of AI.

# Thinking Rationally - The "laws of thought" approach
This is where we want to build the AI with the same reasoning or logical thinking as the way Aristotele tried to create the Syllogism pattern e.g. like: 
> "Socrates is a man; all men are mortal; therefore, Socrates is mortal."

However there are obstacles to this. 
It is not easy to take informal knowledge and make it formal as required by logical terms. 
And there is a big difference between solving a problem "in principle" and solving it in practice. 

Even just a few hundred facts could exaust the computational ressources of any computer. 

# Acting Rationally - The Rational agent approach
A description of an **agent**:

A description of a **rational agent**:

In the *laws of thought* approach to AI, then the emphasis was on correct inferences[1^].

Making the correct inferences is sometimes a part of being a rational agent, because the way to act rationally is to reason logically to the conclusion that a given act on that conclusion[2^].
