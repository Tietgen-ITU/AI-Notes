Arc consistency is when the values in the domain is consistent with the binary constraints[^1] between two variables $x_i$ and $x_y$. 

It is important to notice that arc consistency is only for **binary constraints**. If there are no binary constraints then the arc is already consistent.

[^1] Binary constraint is when a rule includes more than one variable. That is, it only includes two e.g $x_1 \neq x_2$
