This is the uninformed search algorithms also called the *blind search*. 

This means that there is no additional information about states beyond what is being provided in the problem definition that we are trying to solve.

>"All they can do is generate successors and distinguish a goal state from a non-goal state"

Strategies where the search algorithm can figure out if the non-goal state is more promising is called **informed search** or **heuristic search** (e.g. A* is one of them).
