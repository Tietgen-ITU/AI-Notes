We want to define what is a *"strong"* heuristic.

The **manhattan** distance is the number of blocks to its destination.

The two different heuristics we have in the above picture we like the manhatten distance. That is becuase we now know that it is admissible and it is the closest to the real distance of the two.

Heuristic is a function that takes a state and a goal state and then computes the distance/difference between the two.
